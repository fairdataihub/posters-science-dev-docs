# Architecture Overview

The Posters.science platform is a comprehensive solution for creating, sharing, and discovering scientific posters. This section provides an overview of the system architecture and design decisions.

## Purpose

The Posters.science platform, developed by the FAIR Data Innovations Hub, is a free, open-source, and user-friendly solution for creating poster metadata and sharing scientific posters. It is designed to increase the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) of posters, making them optimally reusable and AI-ready.

Beyond serving immediate projects, the platform aims to become a one-stop hub for sharing, discovering, and reusing scientific posters at scale.

## Key Design Principles

- **FAIR Compliance**: Ensures all posters meet FAIR data principles
- **Open Source**: Free and accessible to the scientific community
- **Scalability**: Built to handle large-scale poster discovery and sharing
- **AI-Ready**: Structured metadata enables AI-powered discovery
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interfaces for both submission and discovery

## Architecture Components

The platform consists of several key components:

1. **[Overall Architecture](./overall.md)** - Core system design and technology choices
2. **[Technology Stack](./tech-stack.md)** - Detailed breakdown of technologies used

## Repository Integration

Unlike traditional data repositories, Posters.science does not host poster files itself. Instead, posters remain in established repositories such as:

- **Zenodo** - Open research repository
- **Figshare** - Research data repository

Posters.science indexes these posters, enriches them with structured metadata, and makes them discoverable through a unified interface.
