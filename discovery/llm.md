# LLM Search Integration

The Posters.science platform integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide advanced AI-powered discovery capabilities, enabling users to find relevant scientific posters through natural language queries and intelligent content analysis.

## Smart Search Feature

Upon clicking on the "Smart Search" button, users will be taken to the Smart Search feature's page. On this page, they will be able to ask specific questions, e.g., "What new discoveries were presented at ARVO 2025 regarding the connection between the eye and Alzheimer's disease?". The Smart Search feature runs a query through the Posters.science database to generate an answer and provide a list of the top 5 most relevant posters.

### Example Queries

- _"What discoveries related to Alzheimer's were presented at ARVO 2025?"_
- _"Show me recent research on machine learning in medical imaging"_
- _"Find posters about climate change from European conferences"_
- _"What are the latest findings in cancer immunotherapy?"_
